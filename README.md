# INTERN PATH AI
**A Smart Internship Guidance and Readiness System**

---

## Introduction

Students struggle significantly in identifying, filtering, and applying to internships that match their skills and interests. Existing platforms provide listings but lack personalization, guidance, and contextual recommendations.

This project aims to build an intelligent internship discovery platform that:
- Scrapes internship data from multiple online sources
- Extracts and normalizes relevant information such as skills, location, stipend, etc.
- Builds a searchable database of internships
- Integrates an RAG-based chatbot to assist users with personalized recommendations and queries

---

## Problem Statement

Most students struggle to find internships aligned with their skills because platforms lack clarity on requirements, provide no meaningful feedback after rejection, and do nothing to improve weak resumes or guide skill development.

---

## Gap Identified

Existing internship/job platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Naukri, Internshala) provide listings but lack:
- **Centralized Aggregation**: No unified platform that combines data from multiple sources
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Basic search only; no semantic skill-based filtering
- **Personalized Recommendations**: No matching based on user skills or profile
- **Conversational Assistance**: No chatbot to guide users interactively
- **NLP-driven Insights**: No extraction of required skills and eligibility via NLP

This gap indicates the need for a centralized, intelligent, user-adaptive system.

---

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is an AI-assisted Internship Recommendation System that:
- Scrapes internship listings from multiple online sources
- Pre-processes and normalizes job descriptions
- Performs skill extraction using Natural Language Processing
- Utilizes a database to store structured internship data
- Provides a chatbot interface to query internships conversationally
- Recommends internships based on user skills and interest
- Supports filters like remote/on-site, stipend range, and domain

**Key innovation**: Integration of web scraping, NLP, and conversational AI for internship discovery.
